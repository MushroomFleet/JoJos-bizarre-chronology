# The Complete Joestar Bloodline Timeline: A Definitive Chronology

Hirohiko Araki's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure spans over **200 years of fictional history** across two distinct universes, tracing the Joestar family through vampire hunters, Pillar Men, Stand users, and universe-ending threats. This unified timeline draws exclusively from manga canon while noting where adaptations diverge. Parts 1-6 form the Original Universe, concluding with a cosmic reset; Parts 7-9 exist in a wholly separate Steel Ball Run Universe with parallel characters but distinct histories.

# SPINOFFS AND ADAPTATIONS: CANON STATUS

## Canon Works (Written by Araki)

| Title | Status | Timeline Placement |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Dead Man's Questions** | CANON | After Part 4 (Kira's death, 1999) - Kira exists as amnesiac ghost assassin |
| **Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan** | SEMI-CANON | Generally post-Part 4 (1999+), though timeline inconsistencies exist (modern technology appears); Araki-written but ambiguous continuity |

## Semi-Canon Works (Supervised but not written by Araki)

| Title | Status | Timeline | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Purple Haze Feedback** (light novel) | SEMI-CANON | 6 months post-Part 5 (2001-2002) | Follows Fugo's redemption under Giorno; Fugo backstory differs from anime |
| **Crazy Diamond's Demonic Heartbreak** (manga) | SEMI-CANON | March 1999 (pre-Part 4) | Hol Horse and Boingo in Morioh; some contradictions with main manga |

## Non-Canon Works

| Title | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Jorge Joestar** (light novel) | NON-CANON | 36 universe resets, multiverse elements, wildly different characterizations—"too bizarre even for JoJo" |
| **Fujiko's Bizarre Worldly Wisdom** | NON-CANON | During Part 6; character erased from continuity within the story itself |

## Adaptations

| Title | Canon Status | Timeline Notes |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **1993 & 2000-2002 OVAs** (Part 3) | NON-CANON | Set in 1987 (manga revised to 1988-1989); many battles omitted |
| **David Production Anime** (2012-present) | NON-CANON (faithful adaptation) | Parts 1-6 adapted; Part 7 announced for March 2026; adds content (Kira cameos, La Squadra scenes) but no major contradictions |
| **Part 4 Live-Action Film** (2017) | NON-CANON | Only covers chapters 1-17; significant plot changes; planned sequels cancelled |
| **Eyes of Heaven** (game) | NON-CANON (Araki-supervised) | Original alternate timeline story; introduces "The World Over Heaven" |
| **All-Star Battle R** (game) | NON-CANON | Fighting game; Araki's guidebook confirms Parts 1-6 and 7-9 are separate continuities |
